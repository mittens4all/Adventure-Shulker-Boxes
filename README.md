# Adventure Shulker Boxes

This behavior pack uses scripts to add the can_place_on nbt component to shulker boxes and can_destroy nbt component to items.
Shulker boxes can be placed on any block. Any item or block can be used to destroy shulker boxes.
Intended for use in Adventure mode. Solves the issue of placed items like shulker boxes losing their nbt components when picked up.

## Installing the pack:
